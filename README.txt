SOREn
----------------------------------------------
This package provides the Stack Overflow Recommender Engine software.  The system provides information such as the users who might most likely have a solution for a question on Stack Overflow and a probabilistic estimate of the turnaround times. It also provides temporal trends to users in topics (tags) related to the question so that they can have a good idea of how active the topic is in StackOverflowâ€™s developer community.

This is a class project for the course CS6242 - Data and Visual Analytics in Fall 2014.
